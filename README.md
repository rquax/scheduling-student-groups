# Introduction

This code is meant to automatically create student groups, by balancing skillsets (1-5 scale) and aligning interests (free-text box). It basically works as follows.

1. Use Microsoft Forms to create a form like [this one](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=zcrxoIxhA0S5RXb7PWh05UWVyxqPMVJGu5k27p7kST9UN0kzTzNaSkhNNEQ0TURHTE9MMDNFWTJRSi4u) and ask students to fill it in;
2. Download the responses as a .xlsx file and put it in a subfolder 'data';
3. Open the notebook in this repository;
4. Run the whole notebook to create groups;
5. You will find the results in the subfolder 'results'.
